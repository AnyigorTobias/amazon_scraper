Yo la pedi en color verde y aunque en un inicio lo habia dudado, el color est√° muy padre y va bien con cualquier oficina. Es una silla muy c√≥moda y con muchas funcionalidades, creo que es solo cuesti√≥n de que le ajustes la cabecera y el respaldo como t√∫ quieras y vayas viendo. Lo unico medio mal que tuve fue que la silla tardo como 4 semanas en llegar"

,,,"Newtral Ergonomic Desk Chair with Fully Adaptive Lumbar Support - Home and Ofiice Chair for Back Pain with 4D Armrest, Adjustable Headrest, Mesh Back, Tilt Lock, Computer Task Chair",$449.00,Jessica Brady,the United States,5.0,"I have been on the hunt for a decent desk chair for some time as I spend ALOT of time at my desk. I was considering many chairs like the Secret Labs Titan Evo but one thing that drew me to this chair was the green color, the adjustable arm rests and the fact that it folds down to save space (I was also interested in the foot rest too but skeptical because I know they tend to be very flimsy). Initially I saw this chair was on sale and purchased it without a second thought because it was much more budget friendly and I trust the process of buying through Amazon. I was so excited I kind of skipped over the heavy research of looking through all the reviews, reddit, and blog posts as it is still a pretty decent chunk of money and I wanted to make sure I made the right decision. I saw a few negative reviews about the 'aggressive lumber support' and general discomfort from the chair. It was just delivered today and I don't think I have ever more happy with my decision. The quality of the chair is really nice, it's HEAVY which sucked for assembly but definitely is nice to know the chair is sturdy. The lumbar support does not feel aggressive at all and feels so incredibly comfortable on my back! I was even very impressed with the foot rest! In fact, I think the foot rest will be used every time I sit down lol. The chair is absolutely 10/10 and I'm already recommending it to everyone I know. The only drawback I have is that the chair sits a little high up and I'm unable to wheel all the way under my desk (I have a keyboard shelf so that will be coming off). But I would get a new desk if I had to accommodate the chair!"
,,,"SAMOFU Ergonomic Office Chair with Foot Rest, High Back Desk Chair with 3D Adjustable Backrest, Mesh Computer Chair with 5D Armrest and Breathable Mesh Seat for Relaxation, 5 Years Warranty",$429.99,Miles,the United States,5.0,"Couldn't have asked for a better office chair. As much as I like the designs I'm just not sold on ""gamer chairs"" and wanted something truly ergonomic and adjustable AND one that will not only last for years but comes with a great warranty. The seat, height and headrest options alone are worth it and I LOVE that you can flip the arm rests up in case I'm playing my bass or keyboard. Assembly was easy but maybe get assistance if you have back problems, the seat part is a little heavy and awkward to attach to the bottom part. Yes, it is firm which is personally what I wanted but, because the overall frame is a bit flexible, there is some literal wiggle room. Plus I'm sure the seat will loosen up a bit over time once ""broken in"". I'm 5'10"", slender build, and the medium size chair is perfect for me. If you're heavier set or taller then I'd steer you towards the large size. Will report back with any updates."

Would‚Äôve given it 5 stars if it weren‚Äôt for those horrible scratches appearing on inside of the wrist hands because of the terrible tape they used cover it and the sharp pointy thing on the upper back mesh. Overall, I really recommend it for a healthy and comfortable lifestyle plus it complements my gaming setup very well üòÅüëç. Edit: After a month of using this chair, it‚Äôs still comfortable and convenient however the right arm wrest started wearing off and shaking so much unlike the right arm rest. Thus, the manufacturing of this chair is questionable!"

Medium comfortable, probably not worth the price tag."
,,,"yoyomax Ergonomic Office Chair, High Back GamingChair for Big and Tall People, Adjustable Headrest/Armrests Reclining Comfy Home OfficeChair Lumbar Support Breathable Mesh ComputerChair-Black",$131.13,Maggie W,the United States,5.0,"First impressions: I was looking for a highly adjustable, supportive chair that would accommodate a plus size person and this for sure delivered exactly what I was looking for! The mint color is true to the pictures with a slight blue undertone in person. It was extremely well packaged and arrived in pristine condition. Some cautions: This chair is STIFF. It may soften over time but out of the box, there is little to no give in the seat. It hugs as you sit in a very supportive way. If you‚Äôre looking for a cushy feeling sit, this may not be the chair for you. That was exactly what I was looking for as I‚Äôve had a lot of outer hip pain so this is perfect for me. The lumbar and neck supports are intense and not super adjustable. Again, this was exactly what I was looking for and has done a lot to alleviate my low-middle back pain in just two days but I can certainly see how it would not be for everyone. The chair is that it doesn‚Äôt get quite as tall as I want it to. I am 5‚Äô3‚Äù and my desk is about 31‚Äù high. Even at the highest setting on the chair my arms are angled up to my keyboard. The instructions are detailed but the adjustment methods and placement aren‚Äôt intuitive."

But this chair is absolutely worth every penny. It's just built to a way higher standard than the $100-200 chairs. The setup instructions are really good, and the chair is adjustable in every direction. Highly recommended."
